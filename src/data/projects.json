Intended for use with medium to large size touch screens where physical board game figures and markers can be moved around.<br/><br/>🎲 I've been playing Dungeons and Dragons with my childhood friends (#nobrag #noshame) for more than 20 years but with a 15 year gap. And when we unpacked the box after 15 years – the plastic battle figures still looked awesome but the fold-out paper board that came with the game suddenly seemed useless. We did however have a large size touch screen that we could lay flat on the table, so my mind wandered straight to code. And that's the story behind this odd digital retro board game grid that still relies on real world figures and markers.",

For me it's a great example of how a little code can really make your life easier. Every week – my dad, my brother and I take turns placing bets on the Saturday soccer games. Then we all follow the games, cheer and make fun of each others teams via chat. Classic family stuff I guess and a great way to keep in touch no matter what else is going on that weekend. But every week there was always a big fuzz about who’s turn it really was to place the bets. Until I finally made this little app to settle the question once and for all.",
