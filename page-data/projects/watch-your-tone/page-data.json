React in the front-end on top of Node and Express in the back-end talking to a MongoDB database. Exploring the Web Audio API and Tone.js. Matched with a retro design.<br/><br/> 🥁 Press play and start clicking the squares for synth notes and circles for drums. This instrument is meant to be played with and you don't have to be a musician. Make a song and save it to the database. Or load someone elses song for inspiration!","color":"#ca7acf","tech":{"code":["JavaScript ES6","React","Node","Express","Mongo DB","Web Audio API","Tone.js","HTML5","CSS3","JSX"],"toolbox":["VSCode","iTerm2","Postman","Compass","GitHub","Adobe Photoshop","Trello"],"more":["Concept development","Design"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"watch-your-tone"}}}
