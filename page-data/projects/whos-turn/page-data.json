Just for flavor it also counts down the days and turns red on game day. Built in pure vanilla JavaScript.<br/><br/> ðŸ’š This might be a simple website but I hold it very dear and I actively use it every week. For me it's a great example of how a little code can really make your life easier. Every week â€“Â my dad, my brother and I take turns placing bets on the Saturday soccer games. Then we all follow the games, cheer and make fun of each others teams via chat. Classic family stuff I guess and a great way to keep in touch no matter what else is going on that weekend. But every week there was always a big fuzz about whoâ€™s turn it really was to place the bets. Until I finally made this little app to settle the question once and for all.","color":"#11aa11","tech":{"code":["JavaScript ES6","HTML5","CSS3"],"toolbox":["VSCode","GitHub"],"more":["Design"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"whos-turn"}}}
